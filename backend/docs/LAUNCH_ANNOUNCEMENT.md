# 🚀 Launch Announcement: ComplianceDesk Registry Edition

## Headline: Stop Verifying the Same Driver Twice. Introducing the ComplianceDesk Registry. 🛡️

### Body:
We are proud to announce the biggest update to ComplianceDesk.ai: **The Unified Registry.**

In the logistics and staffing industry, re-verifying the same worker every time they switch contracts is a waste of time and money.

**What’s New?**

🚫 **Anti-Fraud "Clash Detection"**: Our system now detects if a user is already verified. If they try to game the system, they are blocked and flagged to you instantly.

♻️ **Lifecycle Management**: Compliance isn't a one-time check. Our new Expiry Engine automatically tracks document validity and nags the user (via WhatsApp) and you (via Email) 30 days before expiry.

🔍 **Global Search**: Admins can now instantly look up verification status by mobile number across the entire platform history.

**The Result?** One Identity. Zero Redundancy. 100% Compliance.
